Welcome to Angry Alex! A multiplayer game where you can collect and shoot things at other players!

Storyline: 

You are in a post apocalyptic world where the land is desolate and resources are few and far between, except for the random junk or treasure you find lying around. You better grab everything you can before someone else does, or they might take your stuff too! Watch out for dangers like quicksand, fire, and other players! Staying on the road is the faster route, but all the good stuff is in the surrounding desert.

How to play:

Use the Up arrow to move forward and the down arrow to move backwards. Use the Left and Right arrow keys to turn while in motion. Use the space key to shoot your weapon.
